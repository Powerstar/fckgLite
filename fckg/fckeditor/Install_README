UNIX
The fckeditor/userfiles directory contains three symbolic links, all pointing 
to DokuWiki's data/media directory.  If for some reason this is not the case, correct
these links so that they do point to data/media.

Files can be uploaded from either the image tool or the link tool.  In each case, the upload
panel is for quick uploads, in which the file will be sent to the top level of data/media.
If the user instead clicks on the "Browse Server" button, it will be possible to create
new directories and to upload your files to these directories.  

WINDOWS
To use the above you must create three Windows junctions as opposed to unix links.  But
Windows users shuould not need these, if the software installs correctly.  See the document
on the fckgLIlte webset concening media and/or the header to the file config.js in
the directory fckg/fckeditor/editor/filemanager/connectors/php


SKINS
There are three color schemes or "skins" for the toolbar.  DokuWikiFCK uses the 'silver'
skin as its default color scheme.  You can change this to the ochre color scheme that came
with previous versions of DokuWikiFCK or to one based on Microsoft Office 2003.  

To do this go to the file fckeditor/fckskin.js and follow the instructions;
it's simply matter of uncommenting the line which activates the new scheme.
