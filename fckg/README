This is the jquery branch of fckgLIte which uses calls to jquery to handle
ajax and contains a substitute jquery class that mirrors jquery calls and
implements access to tw-sack when jQuenry is not available.

For information on the installation and features of fckgLite, see
the fckgLite web site:  http://www.mturner.org/fckgLite


There are two versions of .htaccess files found in fckg/fckeditor/userfiles.  One of these
is called .htaccess.security and allows direct http access only to image files, but not
to any others.  The other is called .htaccess.open and allows access to any files in the
data/media directory.  In this case security is enforced using the "secure" directory
system.  

See the section on Security on the fckgLite web site:
   http://www.mturner.org/fckgLite/doku.php?id=media&#security_and_the_media_directory
Also: http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:fckglite?&#security

This version of fckgLite does not support the new safe-encoding
protocol implemented in Dokuwiki versions starting with Anteater
(11-7-2010).  For that, you must use fckgLiteSafe, which is available
for download from the dailies menu on the  web site.
