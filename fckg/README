For information on the installation and features of fckgLite, see
the fckgLite web site:  http://www.mturner.org/fckgLite

This version of fckgLite does not support the new safe-encoding
protocol implemented in Dokuwiki versions starting with Anteater
(11-7-2010).  For that, you must use fckgLiteSafe, which is available
for download from the dailies menu on the  web site.
