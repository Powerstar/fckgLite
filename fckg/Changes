rev 11-Jun_26-19_09

Note:  For the log of Changes prior to thei document, see the file named Changes.1.

11 May 2011
A completely new handling of the Dokuwiki draft mechanism.  The previous implementation
for accessing drafts was out-of-date.  These changes meant pruning away a great deal of 
unnecssary code (and there is always the chance that an error crept in when pruning).

12 May 2011
Improved Ajax handling for re-naming DW's draft files to fckgLite names, since not
all browsers handled the previous method successfully.  Current method runs an
interval timer to check for DW draft files, whereas previously the Ajax call was made
from the timer function in handler.php.

Changed regex for handling angle brackets inside code blocks (edit.php), using
entities instead of "< " and " >", &lt; and &gt;.

Added assignment of FCKeditor's Editor Node to helper.php's FCKeditor_OnComplete();
fckeditor.html also makes this assigment but has to keep re-trying until is succeeds
in connecting to FCK.EditorDocument, whereas this method is more immediate. This
assigment is critical to the draft system.

13 May 2011
Decreased draft time from minute to 45 seconds (DW writes draft every 30 secs).
Decreased time for renaming of DW draft files to fckgLite draft files.
Added lock to renaming of DW draft files in scripts/draft_rename.php.

19 May 2011
Removed "TEST" designation from the distribution which offers a new implementation of the
Dokuwiki Draft mechanism.

19  May 
Removed DW Renderer's acronym processing from the output to the FCKEditor editor;
this does not interfere with acronyms processed for final output in browser. This
solves a problem of acronymic names that appear in plugins and plugin syntax, since
the editor sess these as acronyms instead of as plugin syntax.
 
23 May
Fixed ACL check in filemanager/connectors/php/check_acl.php which was not fully
backwardly compatible with DW after upgrading %USER% wildcard substitions and which
could fail under some conditions even in current DW distros. 

Put array check into edit.php when checking for guest user in edit.php where
the save and delete buttons are disabled for guests (approx lines 435ff.).  Some
systems got a PHP warning because the $INFO[userinfo][grps] did not hold an array.

25 May
Forward slashes in userewrite=2 were not being converted to colons, when saved.
This is now fixed in edit.php.

3 June
Re-worked the new draft recovery facility so that fckl draft files are removed in a
timely fashion, so as to prevent false draft file notifications.  Save, Show, Delete,
and Cancel buttons call draft_rename(), which deletes the fckl file, so that
it remains on the server only in cases where there is some interruption of
normal processing.

4 June
Made Call to draft_rename synchronous; otherwise there is no guarantee that it will
delete the draft file from the server.

5 June
Renamed draft_refresh to draft_delete in function calls and fckg/scripts to reflect
the new use of that function (see 3 June).

6 June
Added regex to save.php that preserves %[a-f]{2} sequences, like %ad in %admin,
from being mistaken by rawurldecode for html-encoded characters.

Cleaned up some useless code in meta.php.

Added check in edit.php to ignore draft files left over by DW Edit previews
when switching from DW Edit to FCKG Edit; these are not deleted, as they
are when saving of canceling when in DW Edit.


7 June
Fixed problem where HTML brackets were replaced by entities in GESHI blocks. Open brackets
are now replaced by "< ", and the space is removed on save. 

9 June
Permanent fix for draft file left over after DW Edit preview -- there was a bug in the
Javascript call, which corrupted  draft filename.

10 June
Spoke too soon on 9 June.  With multiple previews in DW Edit, draft file remains on
server.  This is now removed in meta.php set_session().

Added additional check to above by creating a new POST/hidden input item for the edit form
Qbject that appears in the $_REQUEST object only when DW Edit preview is in effect.

20 June
Inserted paragraph break above a code block that comes at top of file to enable insertion
of text above it; it is removed on save.

25 June
Added mechanism to handle swf files.

26 June
Fix for corrupted code blocks containing MULTI_PLUGIN (uses old style "< " and " >' instead
of &lt; and &gt; for html-style elements.

Added flash icon to FCKeditor

Added %%. . .%% escape around characters, which is converted o <nowiki>; this is an extension
of the earlier use of this on 12 Jan 2011.
