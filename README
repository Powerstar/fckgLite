This is the jquery branch of fckgLite which uses calls to jQuery to handle
ajax and contains a substitute jquery class that mirrors jQuery calls and
implements access to tw-sack when jQuery is not available.

For information on the installation and features of fckgLite, see
the fckgLite web site:  http://www.mturner.org/fckgLite

See also fcgk/README for additional details.
